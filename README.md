# Red Pitaya Lock-in + PID Control System (Incubating)

> **Note**: This README specifically describes the specialized Lock-in + PID control system located in the `modeling/` and `rp_web/` directories. It is **not** the documentation for the upstream `RedPitaya-FPGA` project.

This project is an independent effort to build a high-performance, general-purpose control module for quantum optics experiments. While it currently resides within this repository for development, the long-term goal is to evolve this into a standalone project that is decoupled from the standard Red Pitaya FPGA ecosystem, allowing for easier adaptation to custom high-speed hardware.

## Project Vision

Modern quantum optics projects often require precise frequency stabilization and noise cancellation. While platforms like Red Pitaya and projects like PyRPL provide a wide range of functionalities, they are often too general or limited by the hardware's native SNR and sampling rates for specialized applications (e.g., frequency combs).

This project focuses on a streamlined, high-performance Lock-in + PID implementation that:
- **Improves SNR**: Uses a 6-stage CIC filter to handle the inherent noise of the RP 125-14.
- **Simplifies Adaptation**: Provides a modular core that is easily portable to custom PCBs and different ADC/DAC hardware.
- **Focuses on Utility**: Strips away redundant features to provide a robust foundation for specific control tasks.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main layers: FPGA Core Logic, Web Visualization, and Configuration Scripts.

### 1. FPGA Core (RTL)
The heart of the system is the `feedback_controller_top` module, which includes:
- **Signal Model**: Simulates a physical system with built-in disturbance generators:
    - **0.5 Hz**: Ambient temperature drift simulation.
    - **330 Hz**: Mechanical vibration simulation.
    - **1.2 kHz**: Power supply noise simulation.
- **CIC Filter**: A 6-stage Cascaded Integrator-Comb filter with 125x decimation, reducing the 125 MSps input to a filtered 1 MSps stream for control.
- **PID Controller**: A standard PI control algorithm operating in the decimated 1 MHz clock domain, using Q0.16 fixed-point math with anti-windup.

### 2. Web Visualization (`rp_web`)
A real-time monitoring interface built with:
- **Backend (Rust)**: Maps physical memory (`/dev/mem`) to read the Red Pitaya scope buffers and serve data via a REST API.
- **Frontend (Vue 3 + uPlot)**: A high-performance dashboard for real-time wave observation.

### 3. Configuration & Scripts
Parameters such as PID gains, setpoints, and noise levels are managed via AXI4-Lite registers.
- **Base Address**: `0x40900000`
- **Control Scripts**: Located in `modeling/scripts/`, these scripts allow for quick switching between Open Loop, Closed Loop, and Bypass modes.

## Signal Flow and Terminology

To better understand the visualization interface, here is a breakdown of the signals available for observation and their physical meanings in the closed-loop system:

- **Original Disturbance** (`disturbance_sig`): 
  The internally generated multi-tone noise signal (sines without physical noise). This represents the theoretical ideal interference we aim to cancel.

- **PID Compensation** (`pid_out_wire`): 
  The computed output of the PID controller based on the filtered error. This is the calculated "correction" force needed to drive the error to zero.

- **Physical Output (DAC)** (`dac_out_o`): 
  The actual signal applied to the DAC output pin. 
  $$\text{DAC}_{out} = \text{Disturbance} - \text{PID}_{compensation}$$
  *Note:* Because the physical loop (DAC $\rightarrow$ cable $\rightarrow$ ADC) often has a DC offset, the PID integral term will automatically accumulate to counteract this. As a result, the DAC output may show a constant positive or negative DC bias superimposed on the correction waveform.

- **Raw Input (ADC)** (`adc_dat_a_i`): 
  The raw, unfiltered physical signal received back from the ADC. It contains the disturbance, the PID compensation, and real-world high-frequency analog noise (e.g., white noise from the cable/connectors). 

- **Filtered Error (CIC)** (`scaler_out`): 
  The ADC input after passing through the CIC decimation filter. This removes the high-frequency physical noise, leaving the smooth, low-frequency residual error that is actually fed into the PID controller. In a well-tuned closed loop, this signal hovers very close to 0.

### Hardware Setup & Procedure
To reproduce the demo, follow these steps:
1. **Loopback Connection**: Connect **OUT1** to **IN1** with an SMA cable to simulate the feedback path.
2. **Inject Noise**: Enable the simulated multi-tone noise (drift, vibration, and EMI) to the **OUT1** path.
3. **Closed-Loop Tuning**: Enable the closed-loop mode and tune the **P** (Proportional) and **I** (Integral) gains. Note that the **D** (Derivative) term is inherently provided by the CIC filter's response.
4. **Waveform Observation**: Monitor the real-time suppression of the disturbance via the web interface.
5. **Stability Analysis**: Verify the control effectiveness and check the **Allan Deviation** once the loop is stable.

### Results
In our testing on the Red Pitaya 125-14:
- **Stability**: The system stabilizes the output within **+/- 5mV** of the setpoint even under severe simulated noise.
- **Noise Suppression**: The combination of CIC filtering and PI control effectively suppresses mechanical and electrical noise, achieving superior Allan deviation for this hardware class.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Red Pitaya (Z10 or Z20)
- Vivado (for FPGA synthesis)
- Rust toolchain (for web backend)
- Node.js (for web frontend)

### Build & Run
1. **Generate FPGA Bitstream**: Use the provided `.tcl` scripts to generate the Vivado project and bitstream for your specific board model.
2. **Deploy Web Server**: Navigate to `rp_web/` and follow the instructions to build and run the backend and frontend.
3. **Configure Control**: Use `modeling/script/setup_sim_waveform_tuned.sh` to initialize the control parameters.

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Interactive Web Control**: Move PID parameter tuning from shell scripts to the web interface.
- [ ] **Ramp Generation**: Add a frequency ramp feature to support Kerr Comb and other scanning-based projects.
- [ ] **Hardware Porting**: Further decoupling of the core logic to simplify migration to custom high-speed ADC/DAC boards.
